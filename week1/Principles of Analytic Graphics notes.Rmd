### Principles of Analytic Graphics
#### principle 1: Show comparisons
- Evidence for a hypothesis is always *relative* to another competing hypothesis.
- Always ask 
>"compared to what?"

#### Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
- What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

#### Principle 3: Show multivariate data
- Multivariate = more than 2 variables
- The real world is multivariate
- Need to "escape flatland"

#### Principle 4: Integration of evidence
- Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams,
- Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
- Don't let the tool drive the analysis

#### Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
- A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

#### Principle 6: Content is king
- Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integration of their content

### Exploratory Graphs 
#### Why do we use graphs in data analysis?

* To understand data properties
* To find patterns in data
* To suggest modeling strategies
* To "debug" analyses
* To communicate results

#### Characteristics of exploratory graphs

* They are made quickly
* A large number are made
* The goal is for personal understanding
* Axes/legends are generally cleaned up(later)
* Color/size are primarily used for information

#### Simple Summaries of Data
- One dimension
* Five-number summary
* Boxplots
* Histograms
* Density plot
* Barplot

#### Five Number Summary

```
summary(pollution$pm25)
```
```
## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max.
## 3.38 8.55 10.00 9.84 11.40 18.40
```
#### Boxplot

```
boxplot(pollution$pm25, col = "blue")
```

#### Histogram

```
hist(pollution$pm25, col ='green')
```

```
hist(pollution$25pm, col="green")
rug(pollution$pm25)
```

```
hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green", breaks = 100)
rug(pollution$pm25)
```

#### Overlaying Features

```
boxplot(pollution$pm25, col = "blue")
abline(h = 12)
```
![overlaying](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10354653/10299392/6f05b5d0-6b9e-11e5-86c3-40c0652e1c14.GIF)

```
hist(pollution$pm25, col="green")
abline(v=12, lwd =2)
abline(v=median(pollution$25pm), col="magenta", lwd=4)
```

####Barplot

```
barplot(table(pollution$region), col = "wheat", main = "Number of Counties in Each Region")
```

#### Simple Summaries of Data

Two dimensions

- Multiple/overlayed 1-D plots(Lattice/ggplot2)
- Scatterplots
- Smooth scatterplots

- >2 dimensions

- Overlayed/ multiple 2-D plots; coplots
- Use color, size, shape to add dimensions
- Spinning plots
- Actual 3-D plots(not that useful)

#### Multiple Boxplots

```
boxplot(pm25 = region, data=pollution, col= "red")
```

#### Multiple Histograms

```
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1))
hist(subset(pollution, region == "east")$pm25, col = "green")
hist(subset(pollution, region == "west")$pm25, col = "green")
```

#### Scatterplot

```
with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25)
abline(h-12, lwd=2, lty=2)
```
![scatterplot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10354653/10299393/700f1e4e-6b9e-11e5-8aa7-ee1f5e8fd56f.GIF)

#### Scatterplot- using Color

```
with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25, col=region)
abline(h=12, lwd=2, lty=2)
```

#### Multiple Scatterplots

```
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1))
with(subset(pollution, region == "west"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "West"))
with(subset(pollution, region == "east"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "East"))
```
