### The Base Plotting System in R

#### Plotting System
The core plotting and graphics engine in R is encapsulated in the following packages:

- *graphics*: contains plotting functions for the "base" graphing systems, including **plot**, **hist**, **boxplot** and many others.
- *grDevices*: contains all the code implementing the various graphics devices, inclduing x11, PDF, PostScript, PNG, etc

The lattice plotting system is implemented using the following packages:

- *lattice*: contains code for producing Trellis graphics, which are independent of the "base" graphics system; includes functions like **xyplot**, **bwplot**, **levelplot**.
- *grid*: implements a different graphing system independent of the"base"system; the *lattice* package builds on top of *grid*; we seldom call functions from the *grid* package directly

#### The Process of Making a Plot

When making a plot one must first make a few considerations(not necessarily in this order):

* Where will the plot be made? On the screen? In a file?
* How will the plot be used?
    + Is the plot for viewing temporarily on the screen?
    + Will it be presented in a web browser?
    + Will it eventually end up in a paper that might be printed?
    + Are you using it in a presentation?
* Is there a large amount of data going into the plot? Or is it just a few pts?
* Do you need to be able to dynamically resize the graphic?

#### Base Graphics
Base Graphics are used most commonly and are a very powerful system for creating 2-D graphics.
- There are two *phases* to creating a base plot
    + Initializing a new plot
    + Annotating(adding to) an exisiting plot
- Calling **plot(x, y)* or *hist(x, y)* will launch a graphics device( if one is not already open) and draw a new plot on the device
- If the arguments to **plot** are not of some special class, then the defualt method for **plot** is called; this function has *many* arguments, letting you set the title, x axis label, y axis label, etc.
- The base graphics system has *many* parameters that can set and tweaked; these parameters are doumented in **?par**; it wouldn't hurt to try to memorize this help page!

####Simple Base Graphics: Histogram
```
library(datasets)
hist ##Draw a new plot
```
####Simple Base Graphics: Scatterplot
```
library(databases)
with(airquality,plot(wind,ozone))
```
####Simple Base Graphics: Boxplot
```
library(datasets)
airquality <-transform(airquality, Month=factor(Month))
boxplot(Ozone - Month, airquality, xlab="Month", ylab="Ozone(ppb)")
```
#### Some Important Base Graphics Parameters
Many base plotting functions share a ser of parameters. Here are a few key ones:

- **pch**: the plotting symbol (default is open circle)
- **lty**: the line type(default is solid line), can be dashed,dotted,etc.
- **lwd**: the line width, specified as an integer multiple
- **col**: the plotting color, specified as a number, string, or hex code; the **colors()** function gives you a vector of colors by name
- **xlab**: character string for the x-axis label
- **ylab**: character string for the y-axis label

#### Some Important Base Graphics Parameters
The **par()** function is used to specify *global* graphics parameters that affect all plots in an R session. These parametrs can be overridden when specified as arguments to specific plotting functions.

- **las**: the orientation of the axis labels on the plot
- **bg**: the background color
- **mar**: the marigin size
- **oma**: the outer margin size(default is 0 for all sides)
- **mfrow**: number of plots per row, column(plots are filled row-wise)
- **mfcol**: number of plots per row, column(plots are filled column-wise)

```{r}
par("lty")
```
```{r}
par("col")
```
```{r}
par("pch")
```
- Default values for global graphics parameters
```{r}
par("bg")
```
```{r}
par("mar")
```
```{r}
par("mfrow")
```
#### Base Plotting Functions
- **plot**: make a scatterplot, or other type of plot depending on the class of the object being plotted
- **lines**: add lines to a plot, given a vector x values and a corresponding vector of y values(or a 2 column matrix); this function just connects the dots
- **points**: add points to a plot
- **text**: add text labels to a plot using specified x, y coordinates
- **title**: add ananotations to x, y axis labels, title, subtitle, outer marigin
- **mtext**: add arbitray text to the marigins(inner or outer)of the plot
- **axis**: adding axis ticks/labels

#### Base Plot with Annotation
```
library(datasets)
with(airquality,plot(wind,ozone))
title(main="Ozone and Wind in New York City") ##Add a title
```

```
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone, main= "Ozone and Wind in New York City"))
with(subset(airquality, Month ==5), points(Wind, Ozone, col="blue"))
```

```
with(airquality, plot(Wind, ozone, main="Ozone and Wind in New York City", type="n"))
with(subset(airquality, Month ==5), points(Wind, Ozone, col="blue"))
with(subset(airquality, Month !=5, points(Wind, Ozone, col="red"))
legend("topright", pch=1, col=c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "Other Months"))
```

```
with(airquality, plot(Wind, ozone, mian="Ozone and Wind in New York City", ch =20))
model <-lm(Ozone - Wind, airquality)
abline(model, lwd = 2)
```

#### Multiple Base Plots
```
par(mfrow =c(1,2))
with(qirquality, {
    plot(Wind, Ozone, main="Ozone and Wind")
    plot(Solar.R, Ozone, main="Ozone and Solar Radiation")
})
```

```
par(mfrow =c(1,3), mar=c(4,4,2,1), oma=c(0,0,2,0))
with(airquality, {
    plot(Wind, ozone, main="Ozone and Wind")
    plot(Solar.R, Ozone, main ="Ozone and Solar Radiaion")
    plot(Temp, Ozone, main="Ozone and Temperature")
    mtext("Ozone and Weather in New York City", outer=TRUE)})
    
```

#### Summary
- Plots in the base plotting system are created by calling successive R functions to "build up" a plot
- Plotting occurs in two stages:
  + Creation of a plot
  + Annotation of a plot(adding lines, points, tet, legends)
- The base plotting system is very flexible and offers a high degree control over plotting
