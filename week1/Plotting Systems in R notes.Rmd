### plotting Systems in R
#### The Base Plotting System
- "Artist's palette" model
- Statrt with blank canvas and build up from there
- Start with plot function( or similar)
- Use annotation functions to add/modify(text, lines, points, axis)

- Convenient, mirror how we think of building plots and analyzing data
- Cannot go back once plot has started (i.e. to adjust margins); need to plan in advance
- Difficult to "translate" to others once a new plot has been created (no graphical "language")
- Plot is just a series of R commands.

#### Base Plot

```
library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed,dist))
```

#### The Lattice System
- Plots are created with a single function call(**xyplot, bwplot**,etc.)
- Most useful for conditioning types of plots: Looking at how y changes with x across levels of z
- Things like margins/spacing set automatically because entire plot is specified at once
- Good for putting many many plots on a screen
- Sometimes akward to specify an entire plot in a single function call
- Annotation in plot is not especially intuitive
- Use of panel functions and subsripts difficult to wield and requires intensive preparation
- Cannot "add" to the plot once it is created

####Lattice Plot

```
library(lattice)
state <-data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp -Income | region, data=state, layout= c(4,1))
```

#### The ggplot2 System

- Splits the difference between base and lattice in a number of ways
- Automatically deals with spacings, text, titles, but also allows you to annotate by "adding" to a plot
- Superficial similarity to lattice but generally easier/more intuitive to use
- Default mode makes many choices for you ( but you can still customaize to your heart's desire)

```
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
gplot(displ, hwy, data=mpg)
```

#### Summary
- Base: "artist's pelette" model
- Lattice: Entire plot specified by one function; conditioning
- ggplot2: Mixes elements of Base and Lattice
