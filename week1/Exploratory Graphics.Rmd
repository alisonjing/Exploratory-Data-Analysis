### Exploratory Graphs
#### What do we use graphs in data analysis?
- To understand data properties
- To find patterns in data
- To suggest modeling strategies
- To "debug" analyses
- To communicate results

#### Characteristics of exploratory graphs
- They are made quickly
- A large number are made
- The goal is for personal understanding
- Axes/legends are generally cleaned up(later)
- Color/size are primarily used for information

### Data
Annual average PM2.5 Averaged over the period 2008 through 2010

```
pollution <-read.csv("data/avgpm25.csv", colClases =c("numric", "character", "factor", "numeric", "numeric"))
```
head(pollution)
```

Do any counties exceed the standard of $12\mu g/m^3$?

####Summary
- Exploratory plots are "quick and dirty"
- Let you summarize the data(usually graphically) and highlight any broad features
- Explore basic questions and hypotheses(and perhaps rule them out)
- Suggest modeling strategies for the "next step"

#### Simple Summaries of Data
One dimension:
- Five-number summary
- Boxplots
- Histograms
- Density plot
- Barplot

- Please see **Princple of Analytic Graphics notes** for the detailed summary.
